### Checker Program for Java

Designed for Computer Science teachers, this program checks .java files by looking at the text within the files and by running unit tests for functions within that file.
Checker.java has the main method for running the program. Checker.java can check for the following things:

1. Compilation
2. Formatting
3. Variable Names
4. Unit Tests
5. Types of logic used
6. Answers to select questions

These tests can be all run, or only a portion of them may be run, based on the request of the user running the program. A grade is given based on the tests passed.
Unit testing is weighted, and can be adjusted within the program. For any unit tests, a text file should specify the expected input data for a particular function and
the expected output data. The formatting of these unit tests files are specified within UnitTester.java
